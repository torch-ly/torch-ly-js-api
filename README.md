# Torch-ly JS API

The Torchly JS API is the connection bridge between torchlys backend and frontend. This API contains several functions to interact with the connected torchly server and therefore with other session participants.
The API is designed to be compatible with several web frameworks like VueJS.

## Usage

In the current state of this project, it is not recommended to use the torchly API. We are working hard to have this API fully functional soon. Even if it is not recommended, it is possible to add this project as a local npm package. More detailed instructions will follow in the future.
